# Image-based-search-engine
E-commerce websites often have a vast inventory of products and searching for a specific product can be a time-consuming process. Keyword based search queries retrieves large number of products, sometimes come with ambiguity and the generated results don’t match the user’s match intent. An image-based product search engine can help users to find products faster and more efficiently. To address this problem, I developed an image based search engine that can accurately match user-entered product image with similar product images within a database and present the similar products to users. I used advance deep learning method, computer vision technique, for studying feature representations.

The project involves collecting different product images from e-commerce websites, extracting features from images using ResNet-101 model , pre-processing the images, converting all images to linear feature vectors, computing similarity scores between products based on their features and retrieve similar products for users by using those scores. When a query image is provided, the model extracts the high-level features from the image and a similarity search is performed against the feature vectors of database images. The search results are ranked based on the similarity to the query image.
